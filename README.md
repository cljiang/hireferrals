Southern Ocean seawater pCO2 values are determined by a complex interplay of physical, biological, and chemical processes. The change of the surface oceanic pCO2 can be expressed as the sum of the changes in its four drivers: the surface ocean temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), and alkalinity (ALK). 

DIC and ALK are currently not directly measureable from satellite, in this study we aim to extract the interconnections between model pCO2 and its controlling variables, such as SST, MLDs (mixed layer depths), Chl-a (chlorophyll-a), and SSS. 

INTRODUCTION:
In climate science, the uptake rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean, especially the Southern Ocean (south of 45S), significantly impacts future atmospheric Co2 levels. On one hand, the Southern Ocean is responsible for more than 40% of the global ocean's uptake of anthropogenic CO2. On the other hand, natural CO2 is outgassed to the atmosphere in the westerly-driven upwelling region of the Southern Ocean. 

The exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and ocean is controlled by the wind intensity via gas transfer coefficient and a
difference in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the surface ocean compared with the overlying atmosphere. While geographical variations of atmospheric pCO$_2$ are relatively small, Southern oceanic pCO2 varies with space and time and therefore determines the amount and direction of the Southern Ocean uptake of CO2 from the overlying atmosphere. Thus, examining the variations of the Southern Ocean surface pCO2 is thus key to assessing projections for future atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

METHODOLOGY:
We focus on the time period that combine the historical and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 scenario experiments from 2002 to 2012. For simplicity, we select one top performer model for this analysis based on our comprehensive evaluations against in-situ observations, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Earth System Model with a density coordinate ocean (GFDL-ESM2G). 

We carried out several machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forest to build a relationship between pCO2 and four variales (features). We also evaluated their performances and poinpoited the sources of the model errors.
